## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Django
- MySQL

### Installation

1. Clone the PayPer repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/payper.git
cd payper
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the MySQL database:

Create a MySQL database and update the `DATABASES` configuration in `settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

Replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_user`, and `your_database_password` with your MySQL database details.

4. Apply database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the Django development server:

```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
